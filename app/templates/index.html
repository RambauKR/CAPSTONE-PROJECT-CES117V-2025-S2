        <h2>Group 1: Class Attendance System using Facial Recognition</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a system that marks students’ attendance based on facial recognition.</p>

                    <li>Use a pre-trained model or train a facial recognition model (e.g., using OpenFace, Dlib, or FaceNet).</li>
                    <li>Students should be able to upload their pictures, which will be stored with their names in a database or folder structure.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>When a student looks into the camera, the system should recognize their face and mark them as "Present" in an Excel file or database.</li>
                    <li>If a face is detected but not recognized, mark the student as "Not registered" but present in the system.</li>
